# SOLID Principles and Design Patterns in Kotlin

This project provides an overview of the SOLID principles and some of the most commonly used design patterns in Kotlin. The aim of this project is to provide clear examples and explanations to help with understanding and applying these principles and patterns in your own Kotlin and Android projects.

## Overview

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles for writing maintainable and scalable code in object-oriented programming. They are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Design patterns provide a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Some of the design patterns covered in this project include:

1. Singleton Pattern
2. Factory Pattern
3. Observer Pattern
4. Builder Pattern
5. Strategy Pattern

## Structure

Each principle and pattern has its own Kotlin file, which contains a well-commented example that demonstrates how to apply it. The examples are designed to be standalone, so you can look at each one independently of the others.

## Usage

You can clone this project and run it locally to see the examples in action. You can also modify the examples or add new ones as you see fit.
